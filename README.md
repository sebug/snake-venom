# snaKe VenoM - nested KVM lab environment
This launches a single-VM KVM instance in the cloud that has nested VMs - inspired by https://www.exoscale.com/syslog/install-kvm-on-a-virtual-machine-to-get-nested-instances/

Basically just so I have a lab environment to test out KVM.

There will be quite a lot to install on the VM, so I'm thinking of creating a template with [Packer](https://www.packer.io/)
